Beamlit CLI is a command line tool to interact with the Beamlit APIs.

## Get started

To get started with the CLI, login to Beamlit using the following command:

```bash
beamlit login
```

You will be prompted to finish login using either an [API key](../Security/Access-tokens.md), or through your browser.

Set a workspace to use as a context for the session by using the following command:

```bash
beamlit workspaces YOUR_WORKSPACE_SLUG

/// Retrieve the list of workspaces you have access to by running:
beamlit workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Beamlit resources in your workspace. For example, to list models:

```bash
beamlit get models
```

## **Options**

```
-h, --help               help for beamlit
-o, --output string      Output format. One of: pretty, yaml, json, table
-w, --workspace string   Specify the Beamlit workspace to work on.
-e, --env string         Specify the Beamlit environment to work on. One of: development, production
```
