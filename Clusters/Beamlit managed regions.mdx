Beamlit offers a vast network of managed cloud regions powering the Global Inference Network. This network abstracts these regions, allowing users to run serverless AI workloads effortlessly.

Workloads can also be executed on your own cloud (or on-premise) servers in addition to Beamlit managed regions, by connecting private clusters to the Global Inference Network.
