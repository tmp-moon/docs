Service accounts are workspace users (i.e. identities) that represent an external system that needs to access Beamlit to operate resources in your workspace.

An example of service account is the one used by the [Beamlit operator](../Models/Cloud-Burst-Network/Install-Beamlit-operator.md) which you can install in your Kubernetes cluster and that can deploy models on Beamlit based on conditions.

## Authentication of service accounts

Service accounts use [API keys](User-API-keys.md) to authenticate on Beamlit. These API keys can be created and managed by admins from the service accountâ€™s page, in your workspace settings.

API keys have an expiration date which is set at the creation of the API key.

## Permissions of service accounts

Service accounts can have [similar permissions](Workspace-access-control.md) as other users from your team. These permissions are managed by admins in your workspace settings.
