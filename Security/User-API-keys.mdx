API keys are user access tokens that can be used in order to authenticate to Beamlit by API or CLI.

## Overview of authentication methods on Beamlit

There are two paradigms regarding authentication on Beamlit: **short-lived token** (OAuth) use, and **long-lived token** (API keys) use.

**Short-lived tokens** are recommended for security reasons, as their duration is only of 2 hours. They are generated by calling an [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication endpoint.

**Long-lived tokens** are easier to use but are less secure as their validity can go from multiple days to infinite. They are generated as API keys from the Beamlit console. 

## Manage API keys

You can create private API keys for your Beamlit account to authenticate directly when using the Beamlit APIs or CLI. Your [permissions in each workspace](Workspace-access-control.md) will be the ones given to your account in each of them.

API keys can be managed from the Beamlit console in Profile > Security. You can choose the expiration date at the creation of the key.

For production-grade access to workspace resources that should be independent of individual users, it's strongly recommended to use [service accounts](Service-accounts.md) in the workspace.

## Using API keys

API keys can be used in the Beamlit APIs and CLI.

For example, to create a model by API:

```

For example, to authenticate by CLI:

```bash
