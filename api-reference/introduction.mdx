Beamlit APIs allow you to interact with all resources inside of and across your workspace(s). 

## Get started

Authentication to the Beamlit APIs can either be done using [API keys](../Security/Access-tokens.md) created from the Beamlit console, or through a [classic OAuth 2.0 flow](../Security/Access-tokens.md).

**API keys** allow you to get started quickly. Simply [generate an API key](../Security/Access-tokens.md) for your user or service account and use the API key in place of the authorization headers `Api-Key` or `X-Beamlit-Api-Key` in any call to the Beamlit APIs. 

For example, to list models:

```
curl 'https://api.beamlit.com/v0/models' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'x-beamlit-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY'
```

To use **short-lived JWTs**, see [the guide on using an OAuth 2.0 flow](../Security/Access-tokens.md).
